# KiCad Libraries

This site serves the latest KiCad libraries which are community contributed on the [KiCad github page](https://github.com/kicad).

If you would like to contribute to the libraries, refer to the library contributing guide at (http://kicad-pcb.org/libraries/contributing).

Library licensing information is available at (http://kicad-pcb.org/libraries/license).

## Available Libraries

The following library files are available:

* [Symbols](/symbols) - Schematic symbol libraries
* [Footprints](/footprints) - PCB footprint libraries
* [3D models](/packages3d) - 3D model data

## Cloning Libraries

Users who wish to keep up to date with the latest libraries should clone the KiCad libraries using Git or SVN. Cloning the library repositories means that users only need to download _updates_ to the libraries, rather than re-downloading library files multiple times. This can significantly save on bandwith usage and allows users to control which library versions they use.
